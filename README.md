[1] non-"additive" or lacking "additionality" - _Markets define ‚Äúadditionality‚Äù to
determine which actions or interventions contribute to improved environmental outcomes and
are thus eligible to earn credits. Markets strive to only award credits to actions that wouldn‚Äôt
have occurred without the incentive provided by the market. If an intervention is not additional, one cannot claim that a transaction is creating ‚Äònew‚Äô changes in outcomes._ - [_The Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC): Ecosystem Services
Markets Conceived and Designed for Agriculture_](https://ecosystemservicesmarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ESMC-Lessons-Learned-Policy-White-Paper-December-2019.pdf)
